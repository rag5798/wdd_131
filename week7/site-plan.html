			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>To make a website that runs a functional, easy to play card game that loops. This will be for 18+ because it promotes gambling, but should play like a standerd 3:2 blackjack table. This will help me understand asycronous functions and proper looping mechanics of a game.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>I guess it would be 18+ becasue it promotes gambling. Promoting gambling to children is a big problem curently so 18+ would fit better with the website. I could pivot to another game if nessessary.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>I want to asycronously fetch calls from an api. This will run the cards and add them to the screen</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h2>Branding</h2>
			<h3>Website Logo</h3>
			<!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

			<h2>Style Guide</h2>

			<!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Color Palette</h3>
			<!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

			<!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
			Palette URL:

			<table class="colors">
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<th>Primary</th>

			<h2>Content</h2>
			<h3>Home page</h3>
			<p> I need the icon above and then the rest should be in the HTML. The buttons will be on the page alog with any background I decide on. Other than that it will be text.</p>
			<h3>Blackjack</h3>
			<p>API- https://deckofcardsapi.com/ <br> This will hold all the images needed besides my own back drop. Images for cards, card values, etc <br> I need </p>
			<h2>Wireframes</h2>
			<p>
				Create two wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them
				here
			</p>

			<h3>Home</h3>
			<p>
				I want to make a start menu for the game. This will have a few options in the ceter and then credit to the assests in the footer. Above the menu in the middle will be my icon I downloaded. This will have button functionality that brings you to the actual game.
			</p>

			<h3>Blackjack</h3>
			<p>
				I want there to be a table as the center piece where the cards are dealt or something to that nature. This will hold the playing field along with button to control whether to hit or stand.
