ACTIVITY 1:
-From the statement above, how would you define the purpose of this site? Who would be the audience?

-What will our audience come to the site hoping to accomplish?

-What content will we need on the site for our audience to accomplish their goals? What other features might our site need?





ACTIVITY 2:
-Sometimes users will know the book they are interested. How will the design make it easy to find a specific book?

-Sometimes the user will have a specific genre they are interested in. How can they find books in that genre?

-Sometimes users will want to see all books that are appropriate for a specific age (for example: good for 10-12, good for 10 and above, good for 12-16. etc)

-Sometimes a user will be concerned about an overall rating for the book...how can they quickly find the top rated books?

-First time users will probably want to know a little about the site and it's purpose.

-Regular visitors to the site will be interested in the newest reviews.





ACTIVITY 3:
-Start with proximity. Where should we either bring items closer together or spread them apart to fix our relationship issues?

-Move to alignment next. On the example above the alignment is all over the place. Start with the form. Notice that there are no clear lines in that space. How can that be fixed?

-Next look at your whitespace? Are there any portions of the site that could use some breathing room? Add it.

-Next specifically address hierarchy and scannability. What information on the page do we need to make stand out? You can use contrast to make the important bits stand out. Contrast can be created easily with size, color or by changing fonts.

-While thinking about the last point consider accessibility as well. Are your link names and headlines meaningful?

-After making all the improvements that you can think of, review the example below in solution 3. Compare the one below with the wireframe from activity 2. Can you see where the design principles were applied? Compare it also to your version of the wireframe. What further improvements could you make to yours? Did you make changes that were not represented below? Great!
